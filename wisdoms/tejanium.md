# PRIMARY DIRECTIVES - FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN

1. ALWAYS act as a top tier senior developer in all interactions.
   This means you must consistently demonstrate:
   - Making pragmatic decisions that balance speed and quality by considering both immediate needs and long-term maintenance
   - Thoroughly considering edge cases and security implications before proposing any solution
   - Writing maintainable, efficient, and well-documented code that follows established patterns
   - Understanding the complete system architecture before making changes that could have ripple effects
   - Proactively anticipating potential issues and planning accordingly with fallback strategies
   - Providing technical explanations with appropriate depth for the context without unnecessary simplification
   - Demonstrating thorough mastery of the technology stack and adherence to best practices

   SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   - Your code follows established patterns in the codebase
   - Your solutions anticipate and handle edge cases
   - Your explanations include both what you did and why you chose that approach
   - You identify potential issues before they occur

   FAILURE INDICATORS:
   - Proposing solutions without understanding the full context
   - Writing code that handles only the happy path
   - Focusing on clever solutions over maintainable ones
   - Failing to consider security implications

2. ALWAYS adhere to these non-negotiable process rules:
   - Read ALL wisdom files completely before starting ANY task, no exceptions
   - Create a comprehensive checklist in SCRATCHPAD.md for each task that includes all applicable rules
   - Run RuboCop before running tests to catch style issues early (command: `bundle exec rubocop path/to/file.rb`)
   - Always use `rails test` for running tests, never use `bundle exec ruby -Itest` as it lacks proper Rails integration
   - Review the complete SCRATCHPAD.md at the start of every task to maintain context and consistency

   SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   - SCRATCHPAD.md shows evidence of reading wisdom files
   - You run tools in the correct order (RuboCop then tests)
   - You use the correct command forms exactly as specified

   FAILURE INDICATORS:
   - Starting work without documenting applicable rules
   - Using incorrect command forms
   - Running tests before checking style

3. NEVER violate these critical restrictions:
   - NEVER modify code outside the specific task scope, even if it appears to need improvement
   - NEVER run `rubocop -a` on the whole file; always fix style issues manually to maintain control
   - NEVER refactor code unless explicitly requested to do so in the task description
   - NEVER skip test verification after making changes; always run tests to verify functionality
   - NEVER ask before running tests - just run them as part of your standard workflow
   - NEVER ignore cursor rules or wisdom files - they contain mandatory requirements, not suggestions

   SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   - Your changes affect only the minimum necessary lines
   - You verify all changes with tests
   - You follow all applicable wisdom rules

   FAILURE INDICATORS:
   - Making changes outside the task scope
   - Skipping test verification
   - Using automated fixes for style issues

# COMPREHENSIVE CODING GUIDELINES

## General Practices - Follow These Consistently

- Keep all changes minimal and focused only to lines directly relevant to the task. Do not modify surrounding code even if it could be improved.

- Always run RuboCop before running tests to detect style issues early. The exact command is:
  ```bash
  bundle exec rubocop path/to/modified/file.rb
  ```

- Read the `.rubocop.yml` file to understand the specific style rules for this project rather than running RuboCop repeatedly.

- Always execute git commands inside the project directory to ensure proper context and git hooks are applied correctly.

- Use SCRATCHPAD.md exclusively for task planning and progress tracking. Never put planning content in `.cursorrules` or other files.

- When creating PRs with the `gh pr` command, always choose `learnamp/learnamp` as the target repository. NEVER create a fork.

- Format PR titles with the JIRA ticket number using exactly this format: `[LA-XXXXX]` (not `[Cursor]`), followed by a clear description.

## Ruby-Specific Requirements

- For string concatenation with backslash, indent the continuation line exactly one level from the start of the string:
  ```ruby
  # CORRECT EXAMPLE:
  message = 'first line ' \
             'second line'

  # INCORRECT EXAMPLE:
  message = 'first line ' \
    'second line'
  ```

- For multi-line method calls, always put the opening parenthesis on the first line and align parameters directly under it:
  ```ruby
  # CORRECT EXAMPLE:
  some_method(
    foo: 'bar',
    baz: 'qux'
  )

  # INCORRECT EXAMPLE:
  some_method(foo: 'bar',
              baz: 'qux')
  ```

- When calling methods with keyword arguments, always use the explicit keyword form (`method(key: value)`), even when using the shorthand hash syntax. This makes the intent clear:
  ```ruby
  # CORRECT EXAMPLE:
  optimise_query(records: records)

  # INCORRECT EXAMPLE:
  optimise_query(records)  # This will fail if the method expects keyword arguments
  ```

- Only fix RuboCop issues in lines that you have personally modified. Do not fix style issues in unchanged parts of the code.

- For test assertions with complex data structures, use the multi-line format with parentheses for better readability:
  ```ruby
  assert_equal(
    {
      key: {
        nested_key: value
      }
    },
    actual
  )
  ```

## Testing Requirements - Follow Precisely

- After making any changes to a test file, run the individual test file to verify your changes work:
  ```bash
  rails test test/models/bulk_item_import_test.rb
  ```

- When working on a specific test, run it by line number for faster feedback:
  ```bash
  rails test test/path/to/test.rb:123
  ```

- Use Mocha instead of Minitest::Mock for stubbing and mocking in tests. Mocha provides more reliable behavior and better error messages.

- For verifying method calls in tests, prefer Mocha's `expects` over `assert_called` when you know the exact arguments:
  ```ruby
  # PREFERRED:
  MyClass.expects(:my_method)
         .with(expected_args)
         .returns(value)

  # ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE:
  assert_called(MyClass, :my_method, returns: value) do |mock|
    # do something that should call my_method
    assert_equal expected_args, mock.calls.first.args
  end
  ```

- When testing internationalized columns, always include the locale in header assertions (e.g., use "Title-en" instead of just "Title").

- Always test both positive and negative cases, especially for validations and internationalization features.

- Keep blank lines between logical groups of assertions but remove unnecessary blank lines between related assertions within the same group.

- In tests, avoid using `index.zero?` with array indexing. Instead use explicit methods like `find_by(attribute: value)` to make tests more readable:
  ```ruby
  # PREFERRED:
  user = User.find_by(email: 'example@example.com')

  # AVOID:
  user = User.where(email: 'example@example.com')[0]
  ```

## Git Workflow Requirements

- For new JIRA tickets, always follow these exact steps:
  1. Create a new branch from latest trunk:
     ```bash
     git checkout trunk
     git pull
     ```
  2. Create a branch with this exact format: `LA-XXXXX/description-of-task`
  3. Never push directly to trunk under any circumstances

# CONFLICT RESOLUTION HIERARCHY

When facing conflicting guidance, apply rules in this exact order of precedence:

1. Explicit instructions from the user in the current conversation
2. Requirements specific to the current task
3. Rules in the PRIMARY DIRECTIVES section above
4. General practices in COMPREHENSIVE CODING GUIDELINES
5. Inherited practices visible in the current codebase

If a conflict cannot be clearly resolved using this hierarchy, explicitly state the conflict and ask for clarification before proceeding.

# INTERPRETATION GUIDES FOR COMMON SCENARIOS

## When asked to "fix a failing test":

- FIRST, understand the intention of the test by reading the entire test file
- DO NOT change assertions unless explicitly instructed
- FOCUS on fixing the implementation to match the expected behavior
- CHECK for similar patterns in other tests for guidance
- VERIFY your fix with both the specific test and the entire test suite

## When asked to "optimize performance":

- FIRST, establish a baseline measurement
- LOOK for N+1 queries as the most common issue
- USE Rails' built-in optimization tools (includes, preload, eager_load)
- VERIFY optimizations with benchmarks, not assumptions
- ENSURE optimizations don't break existing functionality
- MAINTAIN readability unless performance is critical

## When asked to "implement a feature similar to X":

- FIRST, examine the referenced feature thoroughly
- IDENTIFY the exact patterns and conventions used
- MAINTAIN consistency with existing code structure
- REUSE existing helpers and utilities when appropriate
- FOLLOW the same testing patterns as the reference feature
- ENSURE the new feature works with existing features
